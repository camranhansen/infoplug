		Included with this letter is a functioning, early-stage prototype of the InfoPlug. We hereby welcome you into the InfoPlug community.
		
		To test the functionality of the prototype,

		 \begin{enumerate}

		 	\item Plug the electrical pronged side of the InfoPlug in to a power bar, or wall socket.
		 	\item Plug the second power cord into a power bar, or wall socket.
		 	\item Plug the desired appliance into the electrical socket of the InfoPlug.
		 	\item Using either your personal computer or phone, join the WiFi network listed as ”InfoPlug”
		 	\item With your web browser of choice, enter the numbers 192.168.4.1 into the address bar at the top of the browser
		 \end{enumerate}
		
		With these steps completed, you are now able to monitor the real-time energy consumption of an appliance. By navigating to the "Chart" tab at the upper-right corner, the last hour of power consumption will be displayed, allowing for easy comparison between different appliances, or settings. Simply refresh the page to update the graph. 
		
		
		Though the device requires time to initialize upon activation, if your InfoPlug does not appear to be working, please reset the device by flipping the switch to the ”OFF” position, then returning it to ”ON” position. If you have any questions or concerns about the prototype, please feel free to contact us at noah.merali@gmail.com. 
		
		We encourage you to experiment using a variety of your different appliances and the InfoPlug. The knowledge gained from the results may shock you!
		
		\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
